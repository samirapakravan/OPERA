An open source scalable framework for simulating large scale mathematically heterogenous physical systems. The aim is to develop scalable solvers for solving hybrid particle based, graph networks, and continuum descriptions simultaneously.

This library is under construction at this time. OPERA is based on the PETSc framework.
